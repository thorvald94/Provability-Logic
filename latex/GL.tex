In this section we will prove some different properties about the modal logic
\textbf{GL}, that was introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:Pre}.
These properties will be used in the following chapters. Some of these
properties might not
hold in other modal logics, but we will look at \GL\ as our base logic,
instead of a more common modal logic like \textbf{K}.
Further, in the end we will introduce the system $\text{\textbf{GLS}}$ (the
"\textbf{S}" stands for Solovay).

This section will follow \citet{Smor1985}, but there will be a some small
differences. Smorynski calls the logic \textbf{GL} for \textbf{PRL} which
stands for \textit{Pr}ovability \textit{L}ogic, and he denotes the logic we
have called \textbf{GLS} by $\textbf{PRL}^\omega$.\footnote{Smorinsky also has a
slightly different definition of a Kripke model.}

We start of by proving the finite tree theorem for \GL. This theorem makes it
possible for us to assume that for a Kripke model $\mathcal{K}=\la W,R,\phi\ra$ of
\GL, that the set $W$ is finite. For proving this theorem we will first need
the need some knowledge about trees and
prove König's lemma.

After this we will prove the continuity theorem which we will use a lot in
chapter 5, for the proof of the fixed point theorem.

We will end this chapter by defining the logic \GLS\ and show some few results
about this logic.

This chapter (and the following one) does not use the preceding sections about
recursive theory and the arithmetical hierarchy. We will only
focus on modal logic and not anything that has to do with arithmetic. In
chapter \ref{chap:Complete} we will combine all three parts; the recursion
theory, the arithmetic and the modal logic.


\section{Trees and \GL}

It is known that \textbf{GL} is weakly complete with respect to conversely
well-founded transitive frames. Now, if we turn to the subject of graph theory we can observe a 
similar result, which is that \GL is complete with respect to finite trees.  The goal of this
section is to prove this result. We will first start out by defining the notion
of a tree and a few results about these.

\subsection{Trees}
In this subsection the notion of a special type of graphs called trees will be
introduced. The goal of this section is to prove König's lemma about trees. 
This section will be written in a mix of the language of graph theory and the
language of modal logic frames. Normally König's Lemma is stated in the
language of only graph theory.

We
will start of by defining the notion of a tree.
\begin{defi}
	A \textit{tree} is a tuple $\mathcal{T}=\la W,R,w_0\ra$ where $(W,R)$ where:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $R$ is transitive and asymmetric.
		\item $w_0$ is the minimal element of $R$. I.e $w_0
			Rw$ for all $w\in W$.
		\item The set of predecessors of any element is finite and
			linearly ordered by $R$.
	\end{enumerate}
	A tree is \textit{infinite} if the set $W$ is infinite.
\end{defi}

It is clear that trees can be seen as a special form of frames.

We will state some immediate definitions that are needed to state the lemma.
\begin{defi}
	The \textit{nodes} of a tree $\mathcal{T}=\la W,R,w_0\ra$ are the
	elements of the set $W$. Normally in graph theory these are called
	vertices.
	We say that there is a \textit{path} between node $w$ and $v$ if and only if
	$wR^{n}v$ for some $n$.

\end{defi}


It is known from the course \textit{Diskret matematik} that between any two
nodes there is exactly one path in a tree. 
As the concept of a tree is assumed to be known, we will not look at any concrete
examples.
We will need
some further definitions to state and prove König's lemma:
\begin{defi}
	Let $w$ be a node of a tree $\mathcal{T}$, we will then call the node
	$v$ such that $vRw$ for the \textit{parent node} of $w$. Since the
	relation $R$ is transitive and anti-symmetric, we know that there can
	maximal be one parent node for each $w$.

	The \textit{child nodes} of $w$ are the elements of the set
	$\{v\in W:wRv\}$, i.e the child nodes of $w$ are all the
	nodes of $\mathcal{T}$ to which $w$ is the parent. If $w$ has no child
	nodes it is called a \textit{leaf node}.
\end{defi}
\begin{defi}
	A subset $\Gamma$ of a tree $\mathcal{T}$ is called a
	\textit{branch} if and only if all the following conditions hold:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $w_0\in\Gamma$.
		\item The parent node of each $w\in\Gamma\setminus\{w_0\}$ is
			in $\Gamma$.
		\item Each node in $\Gamma$ is either a leaf node in
			$\mathcal{T}$ or has exactly one child node in
			$\Gamma$.
	\end{enumerate}
	A branch $\Gamma$ is called \textit{infinite} if and only if it has no
	leaf node at the end.
\end{defi}
\begin{defi}
	A tree $\mathcal{T}$ is called a \textit{finitely branching tree} if
	every node of $\mathcal{T}$ has finitely many child nodes.
\end{defi}

The proof of König's lemma will depend on the following axiom:
\begin{axiom}[Axiom of Dependent Choice]
	Let $R$ be a relation on a set $W$ and suppose that:
	\[\forall w\in W\exists v\in W: wRv\]
	Then there exists a sequence $(w_n)_{n\in\omega}\in W$ such that
	\[\forall n\in\omega: w_nRw_{n+1}\]
\end{axiom}

This axiom is a weak form of the axiom of choice, which makes it controversial. This controversy will not be commented on here. 


In the proof of König's,
lemma we will look at the subset of all nodes with infinitely many descendants
and the relation $R$. This relation and
set
fulfills the conditions of the axiom and we can thus create the sequence
$(w_n)_{n\in\omega}$.

We can now state König's lemma:
\begin{lemma}[König's Lemma]
	\label{lem:kong}
	Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a finitely branching tree. Then it is infinite if
	and only if has an infinite path.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	($\Leftarrow$)
	If $\mathcal{T}$ has an infinite path, then it is trivially true that
	$\mathcal{T}$ is infinite. 

	($\Rightarrow$) Assume that $\mathcal{T}$ is infinite. To show that
	$\mathcal{T}$ has an infinite path is the same as showing that it has
	an infinite branch. We will show that there is a sequence of nodes
	$w=(w_0,w_1,w_2,\ldots)$ in $\mathcal{T}$ such that the following holds:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $w_0$ is the root node.
		\item $w_{n+1}$ is a child node of $w_n$.
		\item each $w_n$ has infinitely many descendants i.e. the
			set $\{v\in W:w_nRv\}$ is a infinite set.
	\end{enumerate}
	Then $w$ is a branch of infinite length, and thus $\mathcal{T}$ has an
	infinite path.

	We start with the root node $w_0$. It has a finite number of child
	nodes. Suppose for contradiction that each of these child nodes had a
	finite number of descendants, but this would mean that $w_0$ would have
	a finite number of descendants, and thus that $\mathcal{T}$ would be
	finite. Therefore $w_0$ has a child node with infinitely many
	descendants; let $w_1$ be one of those.

	Now suppose that node $w_k$ has infinitely many descendants. By the
	same argument as before, we get that $w_k$ has at least one child node
	with infinitely many descendants. Let $w_{k+1}$ be one of these. We have
	thus shown how the sequence $w$ can be constructed, and the lemma
	follows by the axiom of dependent choice.
\end{proof}

It is clear that finite trees are conversely well-founded frames. This fact is crucial
in the proof of the theorem in the next subsection, which can be seen as strengthening the
weak completeness theorem of chapter \ref{chap:Pre}.

\subsection{The Finite Tree Theorem}
We now present the Finite Tree Theorem, which is a stronger version of the weak completeness
theorem for \GL, because trees are a subset of the transitive conversely well-founded models. 
The purpose is to show that we can, without loss of generality, assume that 
our model is finite. This last feature will be a crucial 
part in the proof of the main theorems in the next chapter. 

\begin{thm}[The Finite Tree Theorem]
	Let $\alpha$ be a modal formula. Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\vdash_\GL\alpha$.
		\item $\alpha$ is true in all models on finite trees.
		\item $\alpha$ is valid in all models on finite trees.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
With this theorem, it is possible to only consider finite frames. This will make
the proof of our main theorem of chapter \ref{chap:Complete} possible. We will
call the class of finite trees for FT, and call a formula valid in this class
of models for FT-valid.
\begin{proof}
	The implications $(1)\Rightarrow (2)$ and $(1)\Rightarrow(3)$ follow
	by the completeness theorem \ref{thm:GLcomplete}. We also have that $(2)\Leftrightarrow (3)$
	is true since $(3)\Rightarrow(2)$ is trivial and $(2)\Rightarrow(3)$
	follows since finite trees  are transitive.. Thus we will just have to show $(2)\Rightarrow(1)$

	We will show this by contraposition, i.e $\neg(1)\Rightarrow\neg(2)$.
	Assume that $\not\vdash_{\GL}\alpha$ and
let $\mathcal{K}$ be the following model $\mathcal{K}=\la W,R,w_0,\phi\ra $
which we assume to be  a counter model i.e
	$\not\vDash_{w_0}^{K}\alpha$. We know that such a counter-model
	exists by the completeness theorem for \GL. Let $S$ be the set of subformulae of
	$\alpha$ The goal is now to define a finite tree
	model: $\mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{T}}=\la
	W_T,R_{\mathcal{T}},\phi_{\mathcal{T}}\ra$. We will do this be
	letting $W_\T$ consist of finite $R$-increasing sequences from
	$\mathcal{K}$.

	\textbf{Stage 0:} Let the sequence $(w_0)$ be a part of
	$K_{\mathcal{T}}$.

	\textbf{Stage $n+1$:} For each sequence $(w_0,\ldots w_n)\in
	W_{\mathcal{T}}$ we
	will look at $\Gamma=\{\Box\beta\in S(\alpha):\
	w_n\in\phi(\Box\beta)\}$.
	If $\Gamma=\emptyset$ then we do not extend the sequence $(w_0,\ldots
	w_n)$. Otherwise we will for each $\Box\beta\in\Gamma$ choose a node
	$v\in W$ such that $w_0Rv$, and such that we have:
	\[v\in\phi(\Box\beta),\ v\not\in\phi(\beta)\]
	We can do this because of axiom \textbf{L}. We will then add the sequence
	$(w_0,\ldots w_n,v)$ to the set $W_\T$.

	The model $\mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{T}}$ then further consists of:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The relation $R_{\mathcal{T}}$ which is the usual strict
	ordering by extension of finite sequences. 
		\item	The world $w_0$ which is the root node.
		\item The valuation $\phi_{\mathcal{T}}$ that is the defined in
		the following way:
		\[(w_0,\ldots,w_n)\in \phi_{\mathcal{T}}(p)\Leftrightarrow w_n\in\phi(p)\]
	\end{enumerate}
	This leads to the following notation that we will use for the rest
	of the proof:
	\[\vDash_{(w_0,\ldots,w_n)}^{\mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{T}}}p\Leftrightarrow\vDash_{w_n}^\mathcal{K}
	p\]
	We will now prove two claims, by which the theorem will follow:

	\textbf{Claim 1:} $\mathcal{T}=(W_{\mathcal{T}},R_{\mathcal{T}},w_0)$ is a finite tree with origin $(w_0)$
	Finiteness follows from Lemma \ref{lem:kong}, since the tree $\mathcal{T}$
	is finitely branching as the branches correlate with the elements
	of $S$. Further there is no infinite paths in $\mathcal{T}$, since when
	we go from $(w_0,\ldots w_n)$ to $(w_0,\ldots, w_n,w_{n+1})$ one
	sentence from $\Box\beta\in S$ gets forced by $w_{n+1 }$ and since
	these are finite, the process will stop at some point, and thus the
	path will be finite.

	\textbf{Claim 2:} For all $\beta\in S(\alpha)$ and for all $(w_0,\ldots
	w_n)\in W_{\mathcal{T}}$ we have:
	$$\vDash^{\mathcal{K}_T}_{(w_0,\ldots,w_n)}\beta\Leftrightarrow\ \vDash_{w_n}^\mathcal{K}\beta$$
	This proof is done by induction on the complexity of $\beta$. We will
	only look at the case $\beta=\Box\gamma$. So, by the induction
	hypothesis we have:
	\begin{align*}
		\vDash^{\mathcal{K}}_{w_0}\Box\gamma&\Rightarrow\forall v(w_0Rv\Rightarrow\ 
		\vDash^{\mathcal{K}}_v\gamma)\\
				      &\Rightarrow\forall v((w_0,\ldots
				      w_n,v)\in W_\T\Rightarrow\
				      \vDash^{\mathcal{K}}_v\gamma)\\
				      &\Rightarrow\forall v((w_0,\ldots
				      w_n,v)\in W_{\mathcal{T}}\Rightarrow\
				      \vDash_{(w_0,\ldots
				      w_n,v)}^{\mathcal{K}_\mathcal{T}}\gamma)
	\end{align*}
	And the last line is the same as $\vDash^{\mathcal{K}_\mathcal{T}}_{(w_0,\ldots,w_n)}\Box\gamma$.
	For the other way, we will use contraposition:
	\begin{align*}
		\not\vDash^{\mathcal{K}}_{w_0}\Box\gamma&\Rightarrow \exists v(w_0Rv\ \&\
		\not\vDash^{\mathcal{K}}_v\gamma)\\
					  &\Rightarrow\exists v((w_0,\ldots
					  w_n,v)\in W_\T\ \&\
					  \not\vDash^{\mathcal{K}}_v\gamma)\\
					  &\Rightarrow\exists v((w_0,\ldots
					  w_n,v)\in W_\T\ \&\
					  \not\vDash_{(w_0,\ldots,w_n,v)}^{\mathcal{K}_\mathcal{T}}\gamma)
	\end{align*}
	And the last line is the same as
	$\not\vDash^{\mathcal{K}_\T}_{(w_0,\ldots,w_n)}\Box\gamma$. 

	The theorem now follows since we have:
	\[\not\vDash_{w_0}\alpha\Rightarrow\
	\not\vDash_{(w_0)}^{\mathcal{K}_\T}\alpha\]
\end{proof}

From this theorem a number of interesting corollaries follows: 

\begin{cor}
	\GL\ is decidable, i.e there is an effective procedure for each modal formula
	$\alpha$ that determines if $\vdash_\GL\alpha$ or
	$\not\vdash_\GL\alpha$.
\end{cor}
\begin{cor}
	\label{cor:Nec}
	For all formulas $\alpha$ we have:
	\[\vdash_\GL\alpha\Leftrightarrow\vdash_\GL\Box\alpha\]
\end{cor}

From this theorem, we can also find the minimum element of a Kripke model of
\GL. This leads to the following definition:

\begin{defi}
	Let $\mathcal{K}=\la W,R,\phi\ra$ be a Kripke model. A \textit{pointed
	Kripke model} is a pair $\la \mathcal{K},w_0\ra$ where $w_0$ is a node
	of $W$. In the rest of this, project we will have that $w_0$ is the
	minimum node of the pointe Kripke model. We will often just define a pointed
	Kripke model, as $\mathcal{K}=\la W,R,\phi,w_0\ra$.
\end{defi}

\section{The Continuity Theorem}
In this section the continuity theorem and a corollary of it will be stated and
proven. This section applies to all Kripke model, and thus is not only about
\GL.

The name of this theorem comes from \citet{Boolos1993}, he does not give
any deeper explanation for the name.

We will first need two definitions:
\begin{defi}
	We define $d(\alpha)$ in the following way: $d(p)=d(\bot)=0$,
	$d(\alpha\rightarrow\beta)=\text{max}(d(\alpha),d(\beta))$ and
	$d(\Box(\alpha)=d(\alpha)+1$. So $d(\alpha)$ is the maximal number of
	nested occurrences of $\Box$ in $\alpha$. We call $d(\alpha)$ the
	\textit{modal
	degree} of $\alpha$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
	Let $R$ be a relation on a set $W$. For each $i\in\omega$ define $R^i$
	as follows: $R^0$ is the identity relation on $W$. $R^{i+1}=\{\la
	w,v\ra: \exists v'(wR^iv'\wedge v'Rv\}$. Thus $R^1=R$ and $wR^nv$ if
	and only if $\exists v_0,\ldots v_n(w=v_0R\ldots Rv_n=v)$.
\end{defi}
\begin{thm}[The Continuity Theorem]
	\label{thm:conti}
	Let $\mathcal{K}=\la W,R,\phi\ra$ and $\mathcal{K}'=\la V,R',\phi'\ra$
	be models and let $w\in W$. Let $P\subseteq \Phi$ be a set of proportional letters.
	Suppose that $d(\alpha)=n$, that all proportional letters that occur in 
	$\alpha$ are in $P$, $\{v:\exists i\leq n\ wR^iv\}\subseteq V$, $R'=\{\la
	v,v'\ra:v,v'\in V\wedge vRv'\}$, and $p\in \phi'(v)$ if and only if
	$p\in\phi(v)$ for all $v\in V$ and all proportional letters in $P$. 
	Then $\vDash_w^\mathcal{K}\alpha$ if and only if
	$\vDash_w^{\mathcal{K'}}\alpha$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	We will show that for all subformulae $\beta$ of $\alpha$, if we for some
	$i$ have that $wR^iv$ and $d(\beta)+i\leq n$ such that $i\leq n$ and
	$v\in V$, then $\vDash_v^\mathcal{K}\beta$ if and only if
	$\vDash_v^{\mathcal{K}'}\beta$. Since $wR^0w$ and $d(\alpha)=n$ the
	theorem will follow.

	The proof will be induction on the complexity of $\beta$. 
	The cases where $\beta$ is $\bot$ or a $p\in P$ is trivial. If $\beta$
	is $\gamma\rightarrow\sigma$ then $d(\gamma),d(\sigma)\leq d(\beta)$,
	and the result follows the induction hypothesis.
	If $\beta$ is $\box\gamma$, $wR^iv$ and $d(\beta)+i\leq n$. Then $v\in
	V$ and $d(\beta)=d(\gamma)+1$. If $vRv'$ then $wR^{i+1}v'$,
	$d(\gamma)+i+1\leq n$, $v'\in V$ and therefore $vSv'$ and by the
	induction hypothesis we get $\vDash_{v'}^\mathcal{K}\Gamma$ if and only
	if $\vDash_{v'}^{\mathcal{K}'}\gamma$, since we have that $S\subseteq
	R$, $vRv'$ if $vSv'$. But this means that $\vDash_v^\mathcal{K}\beta$ if
	and only if for all $v'$ such that $vRv'$ we have that
	$\vDash_{v'}^{\mathcal{K}'}\gamma$; if and only if for all $v'$ such
	that $vSv'$: $\vDash_{v'}^\mathcal{K}\gamma$ if and only if by the
	induction hypothesis for all $v'$ such that $vSv'$;
	$\vDash_{v'}^{\mathcal{K}'}\gamma$ if and only if
	$\vDash_v^{\mathcal{K}'}\beta$.
\end{proof}

From this theorem the following corollary is an immediate consequence, and we
will use it to prove parts of the main theorem of the next chapter:
\begin{cor}\label{cor:conti}
	Let $\alpha$ be a formula. Let $\mathcal{K}=\la W,R,\phi\ra$ and
	$\mathcal{K}'=\la W,R,\phi'\ra$ be models, and $p\in\phi(w)$ if and
	only if $p\in\phi'(w)$ for all $w\in W$ and all $p$ contained in
	$\alpha$.
	Then $\vDash_w^\mathcal{K}\alpha$ if and only if
	$\vDash_w^{\mathcal{K}'}\alpha$.
\end{cor}

\section{The Modal Logic \text{\textbf{GLS}}}

In this section we will define the modal logic \textbf{GLS} (The "S" is for
Solovay). This logic is an extension of \GL, but it is not as well behaved as
\GL. It is this logic we will use in the statement of Solovay's second
completeness theorem, so it is important to know a few basic results
about it.

Further, this section will follow \citet{Lind1997}, since the  version of
the main theorem found in that work is a bit better stated than the one found in \citet{Smor1985}.

\begin{defi}
	The modal logic \GLS\ is the logic which has the following axioms 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[\textit{GL}:] All theorems of \GL.
		\item[\textit{Refl}:] $\Box p\rightarrow p $
	\end{enumerate}
	and which sole rule of inference is modus ponens.
\end{defi}

The axiom \textit{Refl} is added since for we \PRA\ can add the following principle called
\textit{local reflexion principle} (Rfn), which  for any formula says:
\[\text{Pr}(\Godelnum{F})\rightarrow F\]
We will further define $\text{Con}^n$ for $n>0$ in the following way:
$\text{Con}^1=\text{Con}$, $\text{Con}^{n+1}=\text{Con}_{\PRA+\text{Con}^n}$,
where $\text{Con}_{\PRA+\text{Con}^n}$ is the consistency of \PRA\ with
$\text{Con}^n$ added. It can then be shown that $\PRA +\text{Rfn}$ is a proper
extension of $\PRA+\{\text{Con}^n,n\in \omega\}$. So we add the axiom Refl to
simulate the local reflexion principle in \GLS.
Another more cumbersome definition of this modal logic can be found in
\citet{Smor1985}. We follow the definition from \citet{Boolos1993} and
\citet{Lind1997} since it is a lot easier to understand and work with. It
is also the original definition from \citet{solovay976}

It should be noted that this modal logic is not a \textit{normal} one, since it
does not have  necessitation as a rule of inference. If a modal logic just extended
\GL\ with the axiom \textit{Refl}, then this logic would prove both
$\neg\Box\bot$ and $\Box\bot$ and thus be inconsistent; this is why we have not
included it as rule. 

There is no completeness theorem for \GLS\ in the same vein as the finite tree
theorem for \GL. But there is another similar result we will now state and
prove (This theorem is found in \citet{Lind1997}). But we will first need a
definition:
\begin{defi}
	Let $\alpha$ be any modal formula, let $\mathcal{K}=\la
W,R,\phi,w_0\ra$ be a pointed Kripke model and suppose that $w\in W$.
Then $w$ is $\alpha$-\textit{reflexive} in $\mathcal{K}$ if
$\Box\beta\rightarrow\beta\in\phi(w)$ for all $\Box\beta\in S(\alpha)$.
$\mathcal{K}$ is $\alpha$-reflexive if $w_0$ is $\alpha$-reflexive. Let
$\mathcal{F}$ be a class of Kripke models; a formula $\alpha$ is
\textit{r-valid} in $\mathcal{F}$ if $\vDash^\mathcal{K}\alpha$ for all
$\alpha$-reflexive $\mathcal{K}\in\mathcal{F}$.
\end{defi}

If we want to show that a formula $\alpha$ is not r-valid in the class of
finite tree Kripke models, it is enough to find a $\mathcal{K}$ in this class
and an $\alpha$-reflexive $w\in W$ such that $\alpha\not\in\phi(w)$.

The main theorem about \GLS\ is the following, which provides a sort of
model theory for this modal logic. 

\begin{thm}
	\label{thm:MainGLS}
	Let $\alpha$ be a modal formula. Define the following set: $S_\Box(\alpha)=\{\Box\beta:\
	\Box\beta\ \text{ is a subformula of}\ \alpha\}$ the set of
	subformulae of $\alpha$ that is boxed. Then the following three
	statements are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\vdash_\GLS\alpha$
		\item $\vdash_\GL\bigwedge_{\Box\beta\in
			S_\Box(\alpha)}(\Box\beta\rightarrow\beta)\rightarrow\alpha$
		\item $\alpha$ is r-valid in the class of FT Kripke
			models
	\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
The equivalence of (1) and (2) makes sense since we have added the axiom
\textit{Refl}; i.e.
the r-valid class of finite tree Kripke models are the models where the local
reflexion principle is true.

This theorem reduces the decidability of \GLS\ to the decidability of \GL\ and
describes a model theory for \GLS.

	We have that $(2)\Leftrightarrow(3)$ by the finite tree theorem, and
	that $(2)\Rightarrow(1)$  follows by the definitions of \GLS.

	The proof that $(1)\Rightarrow(2)$ is non trivial, and for this proof
	we need the following lemma:
	\begin{lem}
		\label{lem:hvad}
		Let $\mathcal{K}=\la W,R,\phi,w_0\ra$ and suppose that
		$w_0Rw_1R\ldots Rw_{n+1}$. Let $\vartheta_n$ be the following
		formulas:
		\[(\Box p_1\rightarrow p_1)\wedge\cdots\wedge(\Box p_n\rightarrow
		p_n)\]
		Then there is an $i$; $1\leq i\leq n+1$, such that
		$\vartheta_n\in\phi(w_i)$, and thus
		$\vDash^\mathcal{K}\vartheta_n$.
	\end{lem}
	\begin{proof}
		The lemma follows from the fact that for each $k$; $1\leq k\leq
		n$, there is at most one $j$; $1\leq j\leq n+1$, such that
		$\neg(\Box p_k\rightarrow p_k)\in\phi(w_j)$
	\end{proof}
Further for the proof we will make use of the following operation on Kripke models:
\begin{defi}
	Let $\mathcal{K}=\la W,R,\phi\ra$ be a Kripke Model. The derived model
	$\mathcal{K'}$ is defined as follows: $W'=W\cup \{w'\}$, where
	$w'\not\in W$. We further have that $R'$ is defined as $wR'v$ iff $wRv$
	for $w,v\in W$; $w'$ is the new minimum element. Further we have that
	$w\in\phi'(p)$ iff $w\in\phi(p)$ for $w\in K$, where $p$ is any atomic
	formula. Lastly we have that $w'\in\phi'(p)$ iff $w_0\in\phi(p)$.
\end{defi}
We can further define the notion of a sequence of successive derived models:
$\mathcal{K}^{(1)},\mathcal{K}^{(2)},\ldots$ that have $w_1,w_2,\ldots$ as
their minima. We define $\mathcal{K}^{(1)}=\mathcal{K}$ and
$\mathcal{K}^{(n+1)}=(\mathcal{K}^{(n)})'$ and let $w_n$ denote the minimum of
$\mathcal{K}^{(n)}$. This can graphically be seen by adding a tail of $n$
nodes below $w_0$, as seen in the following graphs:

\begin{remark}
	We have for $w\in W$ and for any formula $\gamma$ that:
	\[\vDash^{\mathcal{K}}\gamma\ \text{iff}\
	\vDash^{\mathcal{K}^{(n)}}\gamma\]
	So we can remove the superscript without consequences for the
	understanding. We will do so going forward.
\end{remark}

The following lemma will explain a bit deeper how these derived models work,
and will be used in the proof of the theorem and later on in the proof of Solovay's
second completeness theorem.

\begin{lem}
	\label{lem:GLS}
	Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a $\alpha$-reflexive model, $S(\alpha)$ the set of
	subformulas of $\alpha$ and $\mathcal{K}^{(n)}$ be the $n$-derived
	model. Then for all $\beta\in S(\alpha)$ we have:
	$$\vDash_{w_0}\beta\Leftrightarrow\ \vDash_{w_n}\beta$$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	We will prove this by induction on $n$. The lemma will follow from the
	case $n=1$, since we can use that result $n$ times to get the lemma, and this will be proven by induction om complexity
	of $\beta$. The only non trivial case is the case where
	$\beta=\Box\gamma$, so this is the only case that will be shown:

	Let $\beta=\Box\gamma\in S(\alpha)$. 

	\textbf{($\Rightarrow$)}\ The following is clear for
	$\Box\gamma\in S(\alpha)$:
	\[\vDash_{w_0}\Box\gamma\Rightarrow\vDash_{w_0}\gamma\]
	This follows since our model is $\alpha$-reflexive. Therefore we have:
	$\forall v:w_1Rv(\vDash_{v}\gamma)$ and thus $\vDash_{w_1}\Box\gamma$

	\textbf{($\Leftarrow$)} Here we can make the following deduction:
	\begin{align*}
		\vDash_{w_1}\Box\gamma&\Rightarrow\forall
		v:w_1Rv(\vDash_v\gamma)\\
				      &\Rightarrow\forall
				      v:w_0Rv(\vDash_v\gamma)\\
				      &\Rightarrow\vDash_{w_0}\Box\gamma
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}
We can now return to our proof of the main theorem of this section by proving
\begin{proof}[Proof of \ref{thm:MainGLS}]
	We will just have to show that $(1)\Rightarrow (2)$.
	Assume that $\alpha$ is not FT-r-valid, i.e we have that there is an
	$\alpha$-reflexive $\mathcal{K}=\la W,R,\phi,w_0\ra\in\text{FT}$ such
	that $\vDash^\mathcal{K}\neg\alpha$. Our goal is to show that
	$\not\vdash_\GLS\alpha$.

	If we have that $\vdash_\GLS\alpha$, there are formulae $\gamma_i$,
	$i<n$ such that if we let $\sigma$ be the following formula
	\[\bigwedge\{\Box\gamma_i\rightarrow\gamma_i:i<n\}\rightarrow\alpha\]
	Then $\sigma$ is provable in \GL\ and therefor $\sigma$ is FT-valid. The theorem
	follows if we can show that $\sigma$ is not FT-valid. We will look at
	the derived model $\mathcal{K}^{n+1}$. By Lemma \ref{lem:hvad} there is a
	$j\leq n$ such that
	\[w_{j+1}\in\phi^{n+1}(\bigwedge\{\Box\gamma_i\rightarrow\gamma_i:i<n\})\]
	Since we have that $w_{j+1}\in\phi^{n+1}(\neg\alpha))$ and therefore
	$w_{j+1}\in\phi(\neg\sigma)$ and thus $\sigma$ is not FT-valid
\end{proof}
Since the models used in this proof are finite and since \GL\ is decidable we get the following corollary:
\begin{cor}
	\GLS\ is decidable 
\end{cor}
In the chapter \ref{chap:Complete} it will be shown that \GL\ axiomatizes the
provable schemata in \PRA\ and \GLS\ will axiomatize the \textit{true} schemata
of arithmetic; i.e truth in the standard model $\mathcal{N}=\la
\omega,+,\cdot\ra$ of arithmetic.
