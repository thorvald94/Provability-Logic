\section{Multi-modal provability logic}
\textbf{Evt. bare forklar kort hvad de vigtige definitioner og resultater er i
dette kapitel}

We can extend our language $\mathcal{L}_\Box$ with more modality operators. We
will start of by extending it with the modal operator:
$\OneBox$ and its dual $\OneDiamond$. In the next subsection it will be
explained what we will mean with the $\OneBox$. Latter on we will extend the language
with even more modal operators.
\subsection{The system \GLB}

\begin{defi}
We will say that a theory \textbf{T} is $\omega$-inconsitsent iff for some
formula $\alpha(x)$, $\textbf{T}\vdash\exists x\alpha(x)$ and for every
$n\in\omega$ we have: $\textbf{T}\vdash\neg\alpha(x)$. \textbf{T} is called
$\omega$-consistent iff it is not $\omega$-inconsistent.
\end{defi}
We have that
if \textbf{T} is $\omega$-consistent then $\textbf{T}\not\vdash\exists x x\not
=x$ and thus \textbf{T} is consistent. So $\omega$-consistency implies
consistency; but the converse does not hold. \textbf{Hvis at det ikke holde}. 

\begin{defi}
	A sentence $\alpha$ is $\omega$-inconsistent in \textbf{T} if the
	axioms of \textbf{T} plus $\alpha$ is $\omega$-inconsistent. $\alpha$
	is $\omega$-consistent iff it is not $\omega$-inconsistent.

	We further say that a sentence $\alpha$ is $\omega$-provable in
	\textbf{T} iff $\neg\alpha$ is $\omega$-inconsistent with $\textbf{T}$.
\end{defi}
It is clear that if $\alpha$ is provable in \textbf{T} then it is
$\omega$-provable in \textbf{T}. We will introduce a new modal system
$\textbf{GLB}$, where \textbf{B} stands for bimodal, where we add two new modal
operators: $\OneBox$ and $\OneDiamond$ to our modal language
$\mathcal{L}_\Box$. We will call this new language for $\mathcal{L}_{\oneBox}$
\begin{defi}
	The langauge $\mathcal{L}_{\oneBox}$ is the language $\mathcal{L}_\Box$
	extend with the modal operator $\OneBox$, where the syntax $\OneBox$ is
	the same as that of $\Box$. The operator $\OneDiamond$ is defined as
	the dual of $\OneBox$.
\end{defi}
We now define the system of \GLB. We will later on discuss the semantics of
\GLB, but this is not of important right now.

\begin{defi}
	The axioms of \GLB\ are all tautologies and all sentences of the
	following kind:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[A1]
			$\Box(\alpha\rightarrow\beta)\rightarrow(\Box\alpha\rightarrow\Box\beta)$
		\item[A2]
			$\OneBox(\alpha\rightarrow\beta)\rightarrow(\OneBox\alpha\rightarrow\OneBox\beta)$
		\item[A3] $\Box(\Box\alpha\rightarrow\alpha)\Box\alpha$
		\item[A4] $\OneBox(\OneBox\alpha\rightarrow\alpha)\OneBox\alpha$
		\item[A5] $\Box\alpha\rightarrow\OneBox\alpha$
		\item[A6] $\neg\Box\alpha\rightarrow\OneBox\neg\Box\alpha$
		\item[R1] Modus ponens
		\item[R2] $\Box$  -necessitation; from $\alpha$ infer
			$\Box\alpha$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defi}
\textbf{Kommenter p√• disse regler}

It is clear that $\OneBox$ -necessitation is a rule of \GLB, since we have that
if $\GLB\vdash\alpha$ then $\GLB\vdash\Box$ and by A5 we then have
$\GLB\vdash\OneBox\alpha$.

The next goal is to prove an arithmetical soundness theorem for \GLB. For this
end we need the following definition:

\begin{defi}
	We call the following rule for the  $\omega$-rule: Infer $\forall
	x\alpha(x)$ for all $\alpha(\ol n)$, where $n\in\omega$. A sentence is
	provable under the $\omega$-rule in \textbf{T} if it belongs to all
	classes containing the axioms of \textbf{T} and closed under R1, R2 and
	the $\omega$-rule.
\end{defi}

\subsection{The problem with \GLB\ and its semantics}

\subsection{The system \textbf{IDzh} and completeness of \GLB}

\subsection{The system \textbf{GLP}}
We will end this section by introducing the system \textbf{GLP}
The language $\mathcal{L}_{[n]}$ of \textbf{GLP} is an extension of
$\mathcal{L}_\Box$, where instead of $\Box$ we write $[0]$ and we furhter add
a countable infinite amount of boxes:
$[1],[2],\ldots$ representing provability in $\PA^+$, $\PA^{++}$ and so on. We
define their duals $\la 0\ra,\la 1\ra, \la 2\ra,\ldots$ in the obvious way and
these represent consistency, $\omega$-consistency,
$\omega$-$\omega$-consistency and so on. We can now define the system
\textbf{GLP}:
\begin{defi}
	The axioms and inferences rules of \textbf{GLP} are the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[A1]
			$[n](\alpha\rightarrow\beta)\rightarrow([n]\alpha\rightarrow[n]\beta)$
		\item[A2] $[n]([n]\alpha\rightarrow\alpha)\rightarrow[n]\alpha$
		\item[A3] $[n]\alpha\rightarrow[n+1]\alpha$
		\item[A4] $\neg[n]\alpha\rightarrow[n+1]\neg[n]\alpha$
		\item[R1] Modus Ponens
		\item[R2] $[0]$-necessiation
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defi}

\section{Quantifed provability logic}
There is another way to extend the logic \GL; we can add quantifiers to the
language. We will call this logic for quantified modal logic (QML). The first
goal is to define what a formula is:
\begin{defi}
	$\alpha$ is a formula of QML if and only if it can be obtained from a
	formula of first order logic by
	replacing occurrences of the negation sign "$\neg$" with occurrences of
	$\Box$. 
\end{defi}

	There is not a version of Solovay's completeness theorems for this
	logic; i.e it is not arithmetically complete with respect to any
	fragment of arithmetics. Furthermore this logic  do not have the fixed point property and
	is not complete with respect to any class of Hintikka frames. Further information on this topic can be found i \cite{Boolos1993}
